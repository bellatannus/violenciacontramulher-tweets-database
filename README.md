The database is available in two different formats:

complete db - contains metadata: all of the collected tweets in their original format containing all the metadata (# likes, # RTs, link, etc)

complete db - without metadata: only the tweets collected (without the metadata)

complete db - processed: only the tweets collected (without the metadata)

labeled db: part of the original database (100 tweets) per case manually labeled by me with the sentiment expressed in each tweet (positive, neutral or negative). These files can be used as a training set for supervised classification algorithms.

I used the tool GetOldTweets to collect the tweets, and the data collected was classified using different classifiers.
